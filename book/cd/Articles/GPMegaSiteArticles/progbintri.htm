<P>A Binary Triangle Tree 
      (bintritree) is a very interesting data structure. They combine the 
      simplicity of a Binary Tree (each node having only two descendants) with 
      the 2-dimensional area covering properties of a Quad-Tree. You also get 
      the advantage of all areas being right isosceles triangles (a 90 degree 
      angle connecting two equal sides) that are perfect for throwing at a 3D 
      rendering API, and will never, ever develop cracks or T-junctions. This 
      makes BinTriTrees especially handy for tessellating regular arrays (e.g. 
      height fields) to non-regular triangle densities, so that e.g. close to 
      the viewer you tessellate to a high density, and far from the viewer you 
      use a very low triangle density. 
<P>Normally you think of the 
      triangles in a BinTriTree with the hypotenuse down, and with two children, 
      a Left Child and a Right Child. Look at the simple BinTriTree represented 
      below. The root triangle is A, with a Right Child B, and a Left Child C. C 
      has a Right Child D, and a Left Child E. This subdivision can 
      theoretically go on forever, though you usually stop once you've reached 
      the granularity of your regular array (though you can go finer using 
      algorithmic sampling). 

<P><IMG src="bintri2.gif"> 

<P>In order to arbitrarily refine a 
      particular triangle in the tree without causing cracks or T-junctions, you 
      also need to store three more pointers in each BinTriTree node (or array 
      indecise, depending on how you pool your node structures), a Left Neighbor 
      Pointer, a Right Neighbor Pointer, and a Bottom Neighbor Pointer. The Left 
      and Right Neighbors point to the triangles that are on the left and right 
      with the hypotenuse down, and the Bottom Neighbor is the triangle that 
      meets the hypotenuse. Note that Neighbor Pointers of lowest-level nodes 
      should always point to other lowest-level nodes; if a neighboring triangle 
      is split, all neighbor pointers should be updated to point to the new 
      children. 
<P>Here's psuedo code for splitting a binary triangle in a tree:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE><FONT SIZE=2 COLOR=RED>
	Split(BinTri *tri){
	  if tri->BottomNeighbor is valid {
	    if tri->BottomNeighbor->BottomNeighbor != tri {
	      Split(tri->BottomNeighbor)
	    }
	    Split2(tri)
	    Split2(tri->BottomNeighbor)
	    tri->LeftChild->RightNeighbor = tri->BottomNeighbor->RightChild
	    tri->RightChild->LeftNeighbor = tri->BottomNeighbor->LeftChild
	    tri->BottomNeighbor->LeftChild->RightNeighbor = tri->RightChild
	    tri->BottomNeighbor->RightChild->LeftNeighbor = tri->LeftChild
	  }else{
	    Split2(tri)
	    tri->LeftChild->RightNeighbor = 0;
	    tri->RightChild->LeftNeighbor = 0;
	  }
	}

	Split2(tri){
	  tri->LeftChild = AllocateBinTri();
	  tri->RightChild = AllocateBinTri();
	  tri->LeftChild->LeftNeighbor = tri->RightChild
	  tri->RightChild->RightNeighbor = tri->LeftChild
	  tri->LeftChild->BottomNeighbor = tri->LeftNeighbor
	  if tri->LeftNeighbor is valid {
	    if tri->LeftNeighbor->BottomNeighbor == tri {
	      tri->LeftNeighbor->BottomNeighbor = tri->LeftChild
	    }else{
	      if tri->LeftNeighbor->LeftNeighbor == tri {
        	tri->LeftNeighbor->LeftNeighbor = tri->LeftChild
	      }else{
        	tri->LeftNeighbor->RightNeighbor = tri->LeftChild
	      }
	    }
	  }
	  tri->RightChild->BottomNeighbor = tri->RightNeighbor
	  if tri->RightNeighbor is valid {
	    if tri->RightNeighbor->BottomNeighbor == tri {
	      tri->RightNeighbor->BottomNeighbor = tri->RightChild
	    }else{
	      if tri->RightNeighbor->RightNeighbor == tri {
	        tri->RightNeighbor->RightNeighbor = tri->RightChild
	      }else{
        	tri->RightNeighbor->LeftNeighbor = tri->RightChild
	      }
	    }
	  }
	  tri->LeftChild->LeftChild = 0
	  tri->LeftChild->RightChild = 0
	  tri->RightChild->LeftChild = 0
	  tri->RightChild->RightChild = 0
	}

<P>As you can see from the steps 
      above, when a triangle to be split doesn't share a hypotenuse with its 
      bottom neighbor, the bottom neighbor is forced to split first. Since 
      bottom neighbors will always be either at the same level or one level 
      higher, it will only ever need to be forced to split once, before it is 
      split normally in combination with the original triangle. Two triangles 
      that share a hypotenuse are referred to as a Diamond, and happen to form a 
      perfect square, which comes in handy when representing areas such as 
      square 2D arrays using BinTriTrees. To encompass a square area, you will 
      actually need two seperate Binary Triangle Trees in a Diamond formation. 
      As long as their Neighbor pointers are properly connected to each other, 
      it won't matter that they are two seperate trees descending from two 
      seperate root nodes. You can use this fact to easily create multiple 
      linked sets of trees representing large tiles of terrain data. 

<P><IMG src="bintri1.gif">

<P>In the example above, if 
      triangle A splits, the Diamond formed by A and B will be easily split. 
      However if triangle 1 is asked to split, triangle 2 will need to be split 
      first, so that its Right Child forms a diamond with 1, and then the two 
      triangles in the Diamond can be split. Splitting a triangle deep in a 
      BinTriTree can sometimes cause a recursive chain reaction of many forced 
      splits, but they are required to keep the tree in order. 

<P>With the fundamental building 
      block of Binary Triangle Trees laid bare, it's easy to see how it can be 
      used for the real time display of highly detailed terrain. When 
      tessellating a regular height array into triangles using a BinTriTree, 
      there are a number of criteria that can be used to decide when a triangle 
      should be split further, and when it should be left as-is:

<UL>
<LI>If the triangle is in the view frustum.
<LI>If the pre-computed variance of the actual height values within the triangle's 
      area vs. the flat plane of the triangle (as scaled by the distance from 
      the camera) is greater than some defined maximum-variance quality setting. 
      (This is the most critical one for variable frequency terrain.)
<LI>If the triangle is facing the viewer.
<LI>If the triangle is close to an important object that is resting on the ground.
</UL>

<P>Pre-computing 
      &quot;variance&quot; is easy, and can be handled very well using a 
      recursive function. The only sticky issue is how to store the variance 
      tree. If your terrain is small, you may be able to store a tree of 
      variance values all the way down to the lowest level representable. 
      However with even reasonably large terrain, storing all variance values 
      becomes prohibitively expensive, and you have to cap the variance tree at 
      some level higher than the lowest. I personally use a byte-based implicit 
      tree, which is essentially a large array of bytes, with one byte for each 
      triangle in a BinTriTree down to a certian level, with that byte holding 
      the &quot;variance&quot; for that triangle. The following pseudo code 
      should calculate the variances for a tree, with storing variances left as 
      an excercise for the programmer. By adding a check to see if each triangle 
      is within a &quot;dirty rectangle&quot; before recursing further, you can 
      easily recalculate variances for just a small portion of a map, such as 
      when a crater is blasted in real time. 

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE><FONT SIZE=2 COLOR=RED>
	int CalcVariance(tri){
	  int RealHeight = the map height at the middle of the hypotenuse
	  int AvgHeight = the average of the real heights at the two ends of the hypot
	  int v = abs( RealHeight - AvgHeight )
	  if tri-&gt;LeftChild is valid {
	    v = max( v, CalcVariance(tri-&gt;LeftChild) )
	  }
	  if tri-&gt;RightChild is valid {
	    v = max( v, CalcVariance(tri-&gt;RightChild) )
	  }
	  return v
	}

<P>For more information on how to 
      use Binary Triangle Trees for real time variable Level of Detail terrain 
      rendering, have a look at the <A href="http://www.llnl.gov/graphics/ROAM/" 
      target=_blank>ROAM paper</A>. It's only available as PDF or PostScript, 
      but it's well worth printing out and reading a few times over. 

<P>Another paper to check out is 
      Hugues Hoppe's &quot;Smooth view-dependent level-of-detail control and its 
      application to terrain rendering&quot;, available at his <A 
      href="http://research.microsoft.com/~hoppe/" target=_blank>home page</A> 
      at Microsoft. It takes a different look at view-dependant LOD rendering, 
      with an algorithm that should work great for caves and overhangs, but 
      lacking the simplicity and mutability (real time craters etc.) of methods 
      based on a regular height array.

<P>Programmers who attempt to develop games for network play quickly discover
the problems of dealing with network latency. Latency is, quite simply, the
time it takes packets of information to get from one computer to another
across the network and is a function of the path traveled by packets passing
between the computers.

<P>Latency is not a problem for playing slow moving, turn-based games such as
chess or Go across a network. On the other hand, games that require high
levels of fast-paced interaction between players, known as "twitch" games,
can be severely degraded by typical WAN or even LAN latencies. This becomes
problematic, as players expect the level of performance of distributed games
to approximate that of single computer, single player games--and players
want twitch games.

<P>Current commercial solutions from Internet gaming vendors for the most part
rely on dedicated network segments to provide end-to-end latencies in the
150 to 200 ms range. Dedicated networks are a viable solution to the problem,
however it would be better if networked games operated in a fluid and responsive
fashion in a standard Internet environment, where latencies are less predictable
and generally larger.

<P>Fortunately, your tax dollars have been at work developing technical solutions
for networked games. The Dept. of Defense has invested heavily in distributed
simulation for military training, most notably in the development of the
Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS) protocol, which developed out of
the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency's (DARPA) SIMNET project.

<P>DIS contains a technique for latency hiding and bandwidth reduction. That
technique, called "dead reckoning," has been widely implemented and has been
expanded in DARPA's Advanced Distributed Simulation architecture project
into the notion of "predictive contracts." DIS originated as an environment
for networking together tank simulators, and many DIS applications share
common characteristics with twitch games.br&gt;

<H3><FONT COLOR=YELLOW><I>The Dead Reckoning Concept</I></FONT></H3>

<P>Dead reckoning is a form of replicated computing in that everyone participating
in a game winds up simulating all the entities (typically vehicles) in the
game, albeit at a coarse level of fidelity. The basic notion of dead reckoning
is agreement in advance on a set of algorithms that can be used by all player
nodes to extrapolate the behavior of entities in the game, and an agreement
on how far reality should be allowed to get from these extrapolation algorithms
before a correction is issued.

<P>Under DIS, when a vehicle or entity is created, the computer that owns the
entity sends out what is called an entity state protocol data unit (PDU)
to all other computers on the network. The entity state PDU contains information
that uniquely identifies the entity; information that describes the current
kinematic state of the entity, including position, velocity, acceleration
and orientation; and other information, such as the entity's damage level.

<P>Last, the entity state PDU contains an identifier that tells all other nodes
on the net which dead reckoning algorithm to use for this entity. When other
computers participating in the distributed simulation receive this PDU, they
create local copies of the specified type of entity. Thus, every node on
the net begins to see this entity. After this, entity state PDUs are sent
out at a minimum of one every five seconds.

<P>Without some sort of extrapolation algorithm, the single entity state PDU
sent at start-up would cause the entity to appear remotely, but the remote
entity would be static; it would only move as additional PDUs describing
its updated parameters were sent out. Thus, the motion of remote entities
would seem choppy; they would stay still until the next PDU was received,
and would jump to the location specified in the new PDU. This choppiness
can be lessened by decreasing the time between PDUs, but this approach quickly
exhausts available network bandwidth in scenarios with large numbers of entities.

<P>With dead reckoning, however, after receipt of the first entity state PDU
for an entity, each node on the net begins moving the entity by applying
the agreed-upon dead reckoning algorithm. As long as the entity continues
to move in a predictable fashion, it appears in a consistent, synchronized
way on all nodes on the net with no further network traffic required.

<P>Of course, simulation entities don't always move in a predictable fashion.
The instant a player controlling an entity moves the control stick, the vehicle
deviates from a smooth, algorithmically definable path. Under DIS, this is
detected and handled by the computer that owns the entity.

<P>The owner of an entity remembers the last time it put out an entity state
PDU and also runs the dead reckoning algorithm based on that PDU. Thus, it
has a copy of what all the other nodes on the network are seeing as well
as the true, latest value.

<P>The owning simulation compares the dead reckoning values to the true state
of the entity as controlled by the player. If the dead reckoning and true
state values differ by an amount that exceeds the agreed-upon dead reckoning
threshold, a new entity state PDU is sent out to update the other nodes on
the net. All nodes update their copies of the entity to reflect the new entity
state PDU values, and dead reckoning begins again with the new data point.

<P>Figure 1 shows an example of dead reckoning. At time
t0, a simulation of an aircraft, shown on the left, first puts out a PDU
informing all the computers on the network of the aircraft's existence and
location. At this time, the position of the aircraft is synchronized at all
computers on the network. From this point forward, all the computers on the
network begin displaying the aircraft, and move it forward based on an
agreed-upon algorithm. This is shown as a dashed line.

<P>The owner of the aircraft, however, also moves the aircraft based on inputs
from the user (for example, via a joystick). This is shown as the thick solid
line on the left. The player controlling the aircraft sees motion along the
thick solid line, while all other players on the net see motion along the
dashed line. As long as the dead-reckoned position and the true position
stay within a predefined threshold, shown via the thin black lines, no additional
information is sent out on the network. Network bandwidth is conserved and
remote computers show smooth motion based on the dead reckoning algorithm.

<P>However, a small discrepancy between the owning simulation and all other
simulations on the net exists. When the discrepancy gets bigger than the
dead reckoning threshold, as at time t1, a new PDU is sent out. At this point,
all computers on the network immediately resynchronize their copies of the
aircraft to the new PDU data and reset their dead reckoning algorithms, as
shown at t1'. Dead reckoning then begins again, as shown at t1' and beyond.

<P>It is easy to see from the exaggerated view shown in Figure
1 that large dead reckoning thresholds can result in noticeable jerkiness
of motion when new PDUs are received. On the other hand, small dead reckoning
thresholds force more PDUs to be sent. The optimal values for dead reckoning
thresholds are dependent on the type of application.

<P>DIS simulations also typically use smoothing algorithms to lessen the apparent
jerkiness as entities are updated from dead reckoned positions to new updated
true positions. DIS simulations also typically apply dead reckoning to vehicle
orientation as well as position. Orientation extrapolation uses a different
set of algorithms from position extrapolation, although the two are based
on identical concepts.

<H3><FONT COLOR=YELLOW><I>Dead Reckoning Algorithms</I></FONT></H3>

<P>Next, let's look at the actual dead reckoning algorithms DIS implements.
There are nine standard algorithms, though two effectively shut off dead
reckoning and several others duplicate each other, only using different
coordinate systems. We'll examine the three most typical.

<P>Figure 2 shows three DIS dead reckoning algorithms.
These algorithms flow from basic physics. The first algorithm maintains an
entity at the position specified in the entity's entity state PDU from t0.
The second algorithm extrapolates the entity forward from its known t0 position
based on its velocity at t0. The third algorithm also extrapolates forward
from the entity's last known position, but uses both velocity and acceleration
in the extrapolation.

<P>The three algorithms shown in Figure 2 work well for
extrapolating position. More sophisticated algorithms used in DIS also consider
orientation (roll, pitch, and heading) of entities and even extrapolate moving
parts of entities. For example, a tank that scans its turret back and forth
while patrolling could make use of dead reckoning for both the tank's position
and the angle of the turret on the tank.

<H3><FONT COLOR=YELLOW><I>Putting Dead Reckoning to Work</I></FONT></H3>

<P><A href="#list1">Listing 1</A> shows a fragment of a program that receives
entity state PDUs from other programs on the network and displays all the
entities it knows about, using dead reckoning algorithm 2 from
<A href="#figure2">Figure 2</A>. The code is C++ style, though the class
definitions, program initialization, and other details are not shown.

<P>The program's primary loop first checks to see if there are any new packets
available from the network (<TT>#1</TT>). DIS uses UDP for its communications,
and so here we use a Java-like UDP socket class to access UDP packets. Next,
the raw packets are parsed and converted to entity state PDU objects, which
contain information about remote entities' position, velocity, and identity.

<P>If this entity is already known to the program (that is, its ID exists in
<TT>TankList</TT>), the position and velocity for the entity are updated.
Otherwise, a new entry in the <TT>TankList</TT> table is created
(<TT>#3</TT>). The time of receipt is stored in the remote vehicle table
(<TT>ctime</TT> is a function that returns the current time); this is required
for dead reckoning.

<P>After the new packet is received, the locations of all entities in
<TT>TankList</TT> are updated using dead reckoning (<TT>#4</TT>) and are
displayed on the screen (<TT>#5</TT>). Dead reckoning does not overwrite
the received position, which may be needed for further dead reckoning at
a later time.

<P><A href="#list2">Listing 2</A> shows a fragment of a program that sends
information to the network about a tank it's simulating. It follows the rules
of dead reckoning as well. The program repeatedly updates vehicle
<TT>myTank</TT> based on inputs from the joystick controller. After each
update, it checks to see if the dead reckoning threshold has been exceeded.
If it has, it sends out a new PDU describing the updated state. The program
sends one entity state PDU at startup to let other players on the network
know that the vehicle <TT>myTank</TT> exists and that the program must remember
the last state information and time it sent out.

<H3><FONT COLOR=YELLOW><I>Extensions to Dead Reckoning</I></FONT></H3>

<P>DIS uses dead reckoning primarily as a means to extrapolate position and
orientation of vehicles, and it does so via polynomial algorithms. DIS
applications have extended dead reckoning in one way to allow extrapolation
of articulated parts of vehicles (for example, turrets on tanks).

<P>The DARPA ADS architecture study recognized the value of dead reckoning and
extended the concept to apply to all attributes of objects on the network
and to a larger class of extrapolation. Extrapolations using these expanded
definitions are referred to as predictive contracts.

<P>For example, in a tank battle simulation, a predictive contract called "drive
along road to waypoint" could be defined. Under this predictive contract,
a computer simulating a tank would only have to send out one piece of information
about a vehicle: it was at a certain position on a road, and it was going
to drive down that road to a specified point.

<P>As long as all other computers on the network agree on what it means to "drive
down a road" (for example, that you drive on the right) and all the computers
on the network know the definition of the road the tank is on, all the computers
on the network can create consistent views of the tank without requiring
any network traffic. Of course, if the tank deviates from its planned path
or changes state in any other unpredictable way, new state information for
the tank would be sent out on the network. Additional predictive contracts
could define when the tank turns its sensors on and off, when it sends out
radio reports, and other attributes of the tank's behavior.

<P>The advent of the Java model of distributed object computing allows a further
refinement of predictive contracts. In the DIS model all dead reckoning
algorithms are defined at compile time; there is no way for a simulation
to create new dead reckoning algorithms at run time. With languages such
as Java, however, a simulation could distribute updated predictive contracts
across the network at will.

<H3><FONT COLOR=YELLOW><I>Make the Most of Dead Reckoning</I></FONT></H3>

<P>Dead reckoning and predictive contracts offer dual benefits for networked
simulations and games. They hide the latencies inherent in the network, and
they offer the additional benefit of keeping traffic off the network by allowing
simulations to transmit information only when really needed. In DIS, dead
reckoning also allows entity state information be transmitted via best-effort
communications (such as UDP/IP) rather than more expensive, reliable (such
as TCP/IP) mechanisms. This is because dead reckoning can be used to smooth
over gaps when packets are lost, albeit with some loss of synchronization
across the network.

<P>Dead reckoning is not free. It requires that every computer on the network
run an algorithm to extrapolate each entity in the simulation scenario. Also,
if all the entities in a simulation behave unpredictably all the time, dead
reckoning offers little gain. However, it has been the experience in DIS
that dead reckoning offers significant advantages in large scenarios with
many computer-generated entities. In such situations, and where processor
cycles can be traded off to reduce network use and apparent latency, dead
reckoning can be a very effective optimization technique.</P>

<H3><FONT COLOR=YELLOW><I>Page Flipping</I></FONT></H3>

<P>What is it? Let's look at the DirectX Reference 
      Documentation for a quick introduction:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;Page flipping is key in 
      multimedia, animation, and game software. Software page flipping is 
      analogous to the way animation can be done with a pad of paper. On each 
      page the artist changes the figure slightly, so that when you flip between 
      sheets rapidly the drawing appears animated.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Page flipping in software is very similar to this process. 
      Initially, you set up a series of DirectDraw surfaces (i.e. areas of 
      memory that hold what's supposed to be on screen) that are designed to 
      &quot;flip&quot; to the screen the way artist's paper flips to the next 
      page. The first surface is referred to as the primary 
      surface and the surfaces behind it are called 
      back buffers. Your application writes 
      to a back buffer, then flips the primary surface so that the back buffer 
      appears on screen. While the system is displaying the image, your software 
      is again writing to a back buffer. The process continues as long as you're 
      animating, allowing you to animate images quickly and 
      efficiently.&quot;
      
<P>This explains, what it is, but why is it necessary ? Well, a typical 
      game can have hundreds of graphical objects moving and animating on screen 
      : monsters, players, walls, text, scores, you name it. Now our game needs 
      to update these graphical objects as fast as possible, in a clean manner, 
      changing the position of graphical objects as they move.

<P>Some games keep redraw the whole screen everytime, others keep track of 
      what has changed on the screen and redraw those parts. We'll take the 
      first method for our example. So, everytime your game screen is refreshed, 
      the screen will be cleared so we aren't left with any stuff from the old 
      frame, and we redraw everything. What will this do ? Flicker.

<P>It could take your game 1/50th of a second (or more) to redraw its 
      screen; 1/50th is a &quot;long&quot; time, and it's enough for the eye to 
      notice. Since we are clearing our game screen, the eye will see the image 
      &quot;being built&quot; and get a flicker of the black (cleared) screen as 
      it is being filled up with graphics. It's like watching a magician from 
      behind the stage and seeing all his secrets : it's very interesting if you 
      want to know how things are done, but it kinda ruins the experience.

<P>So this is where page flipping comes in. Like explained in the DirectX 
      documentation, when using page flipping, you draw your graphics on an 
      offscreen, &quot;secret&quot; surface, and when you're done you quickly 
      &quot;flip&quot; it so it appears on the screen instantly (well, almost, 
      &quot;instantly&quot; doesn't have the same meaning in computer 
      graphics!). This way, the eye always sees a clean image, without any 
      flickering or other visual artifacts.
      
<P>But page flipping comes out with its own set of troubles, which are 
      rooted in the way video cards and monitors work, which is the subject of 
      the next section.

<H3><FONT COLOR=YELLOW><I>How monitors work</I></FONT></H3>


<P>You draw a line and it appears instantly on screen, right ? No. 
      Monitors are far from being &quot;instantaneous&quot;; a typical monitor 
      takes 1/75th of a second to &quot;draw&quot; its whole image, which is a 
      rather large amount of time in the computer world. Some newer (and 
      expensive) active-matrix flat screen displays could be dubbed 
      &quot;instantaneous&quot;, but the great majority of monitors aren't flat, 
      and are called CRT monitors.

<P>Inside your monitor is a vacuum tube, completely void of air. It' 
      called a cathode-ray tube (or CRT). Those of you with electrical 
      backgrounds will know that a cathode is the negatively charged 
      pole in an electrical system; the positive pole is the anode. The 
      cathode in the monitor is at the back of the monitor, where lies a 
      &quot;gun&quot; shooting electrons right in your face, which are 
      thankfully stopped by the glass screen of the monitor. Around thise 
      cathode gun is a yoke, which, by manipulation its magnetic charge 
      causes the electrons to be deviated up, down, left or right from the 
      center of the screen.
      
<P>By controlling this magnet in a certain pattern, the electrons can be 
      caused to &quot;spray&quot; the screen horizontally, going down one line 
      at a time, which is represented by this picture:

<P align=center><IMG height=386 src="monitorscan.gif" width=427>

<P>The electrons will hit the back of the glass screen, which 
      is made of rows phosphor, which lights up when hit, The amount of 
      electrons being fired by the gun can also be controlled, providing 
      different levels of intensity.

<P>In color monitors, each pixel is represent by a 
      triplet of phosphor cells, one for red, green and blue. There are 
      also three electron guns instead of one, each one positioned so it can 
      only it one of phosphor cells in each triplet; so there's a red, blue and 
      green gun, the three primary colors that can combined to produce any 
      color. By varying the output of electrons from each gun and synchronizing 
      all this with the screen scanning process as depicted above, we can 
      effectively control the appearance (color) of each pixel on our screen.

<H3><FONT COLOR=YELLOW><I>The Vertical Sync Signal (VSync)</I></FONT></H3>

<P>What does this all have to do with page flipping, and game 
      programming ? Well, first of all, we've understood that a monitor doesn't 
      display its image instantly; it takes a certain time for the monitor to 
      scan all the lines on the screen, and then come back to the top fo the 
      screen. You can't say &quot;Okay, Big Blue Gun, on my mark, Aim pixel 
      100,100 and shoot n number of electrons!&quot;. The guns always shoot in 
      the same pattern, and if the pixel you just changed was just passed by the 
      guns, then too bad, it'll have to wait for the next pass before it's 
      updated. The time it takes for the monitor to scan the whole screen is 
      it's refresh rate, which is typically 75Hz in most monitors.

<P>Maybe some of you will start to see where I'm getting at 
      with all this, big grins on their faces. If the whole idea behind page 
      flipping is to present clean images instantaneously to the user, how 
      can we do so if the monitor device is not instantaneous?

<P>See, if we flip our screen at any time, we will most likely 
      flip in the middle of the monitor scanning process; that means that our 
      monitor will most likely scan part of a a frane, then as we flip it'll 
      scan another image, displaying the top part of the first one, then the 
      bottom part of the second. The effects of this perhaps won't be as obvious 
      to the eye as the non-buffered situation we had at first, but our images 
      certainly won't be clean. For example, suppose that I had an image that 
      would be moving left in my game, it would so something like this:

<P align=center><IMG height=68 src="title2.jpg" width=460>

<P>The bottom part of the image is shifted left. If the game is 
      fast enough and it updates its images fast enough the eye may not notice, 
      but it's certainly not a chance I'd recommend you to take.
      
<P>The solution to this is to only flip during the vertical 
      retrace period of the monitor. The vertical retrace period is the red 
      line on our first diagram, it is the period when the electrons are going 
      back to the top of the display; the guns aren't &quot;shooting&quot; 
      during this interval - they are simply repositioning themselves for the 
      next pass. When beggining this vertical retrace, the monitor sends a 
      special signal, called the vertical sync signal, to notify that 
      it is going back to the top of its image and it is okay to flip now.

<P>So what do need to do to synchronize to this vertical sync 
      signal ? Well, nothing, videocards often will only flip when the monitor 
      is in its vertical sync period, so you don't have the choice anyways. When 
      using DirectX, everything is handled for you; when you ask DirectX to flip 
      an image, it says &quot;Okay, I'll put this on my agenda&quot;, and flips 
      whenever the time is right.

<P>Alas, alas, this vertical sync signal brings another bunch 
      of troubles all its own...

<H3><FONT COLOR=YELLOW><I>The Bad Effects of Buffering</I></FONT></H3>

<P>This whole buffering and synchronizing stuff 
      also brings up plenty of troubles. The first trouble is relatively obvious 
      : your game's framerate can never be any higher than the monitor's 
      framerate. This is not a big problem however, since most monitors output 
      75 images per second, which is already triple what you get on television. 
      But it tells us there is an upper limit to teh amount of performance your 
      game can provide, and no optimization in the world will make your game go 
      past that limit unless you dump the page flipping.

<P>There is a much more serious problem. To 
      explain this, let's first look at a simple time graph that shows how the 
      monitor updates the screen:

<P align=center><IMG height=155 src="vsync.gif" width=424></p>

<P>Now, as I stated earlier, we can only flip the 
      screen within the VSync interval. Now let's say that our game is fast, and 
      it can update its screen twice as fast as the monitor. So it makes its 
      picture, and it asks for the flip. DirectX says &quot;Sure, I'll do it 
      when it's time&quot;. Good. So our game just goes on and writes its data 
      to the other available buffer...

<P>Wait. There is no other available buffer. The 
      primary buffer is currently beig scanned by the monitor, so we can't touch 
      it, and the back buffer is the one our game has just finished drawing. 
      What can we do ? Nothing. You wait. Now you could use this idle 
      time to do something else, like make calculations, update the game's AI, 
      etc, but there are very few tasks a game could do that can just be picked 
      up like that, just when there is time to do it. So all you can do is wait. 
      The next thing you know, your prime-time game capable of running at 75 
      frames per second is only running at 38, losing half your time. 
      This is easily illustrated by the next example:

<P align=center><IMG height=223 src="vsync2.gif" width=480></P>

<P>This is a worst-case scenario, with the monitor 
      running at 75Hz. The blue line tracks where the monitor is scanning from, 
      and the yellow line tracks where the game is writing to. At first, the 
      monitor scans from the 1st surface, and the game writes onto the second 
      surface. In this scenario, the game is just the same speed as the monitor, 
      i.e. it finishes its drawing right when the monitor is starting a new 
      scan. Unfortunately, at that point it's already too late : the game should 
      finish drawing before the monitor's vertical sync (the red 
      blocks).

<P>In this case, the game issues its flip request 
      just a split-nanosecond too late, right when the VSync has finished. This 
      is indicated by the violet arrows. The game (yellow line), should go to 
      the other surface to continue, but it can't; the monitor's already there 
      (traffic jam). So it waits in the middle, doing nothing. It's only when 
      the flip request is processed, when the monitor finally gets off the 1st 
      surface, that the game can get on it and begin its next drawing, in a 
      neverending cycle.

<P>In this case, the game has enough &quot;juice&quot; to be 
      able to output 75 frames per second. But because it is constantly waiting 
      for the monitor, the best that this game will get is half the monitor's 
      framerate, or 37.5 frames per second, losing almost half of its 
      efficiency. In double-buffered schemes, you very often get framerates that 
      are only simple fractions of the monitor's framerate : 75, or 37.5 which 
      is 75/2, 25 which is 75/3, 18.75 which is 75/4, and so forth. You can 
      verify this with the <A href="screenbench.zip">ScreenBench</A> 
      utility I made.

<P>Performance-wise, this means that you could do vast amounts 
      of optimization without any effect on your framerate, up until you reach a 
      certain threshold of optimization where your framerate would climb 
      significantly - it's like if your game could only shift into certain 
      predefined speeds.
      
<H3><FONT COLOR=YELLOW><I>Enter Triple Buffering</I></FONT></H3>

<P>So what's the solution? Well, the solution is to add a 
      third &quot;lane&quot;, another buffer, kind of a &quot;backup&quot; that 
      the game can rely on. DirectX (and Armagammon) handles the details of 
      setting triple buffering, you can simply specify how many buffers you 
      want.

<P>This diagram illustrates how triple buffering works:

<P align=center><IMG height=300 src="vsync3.gif" width=480>

<P>I think the graph speaks for itself. With triple buffering, 
      the game (yellow line), always has some place to go, it's never 
      &quot;blocked&quot; by the monitor, and it never waits between two lines. 
      In this case, the game can gain its full speed, and reach the monitor's 
      framerate (75Hz). Note that even with triple buffering the best framerate 
      you will be able to get is the monitor's framerate.

<P>The downside of triple buffering is that you have to pay for 
      the extra video memory you will be using (don't try setting up triple 
      buffering with one of the three surfaces in system memory, you can only 
      gain a negative performance hit this way); your extra surface will cost 
      you around half a meg of video memory in 8-bit graphics mode, a full meg 
      in 16-bit graphics mode. Some videocards still come equipped with only 2 
      or 4 megs of video memory, and on these cards triple buffering can only be 
      setup in the most basic screen resolution modes.

<H3><FONT COLOR=YELLOW><I>Conclusion</I></FONT></H3>

<P>Despite these minor shortcomings, I think it's worth it to 
      setup triple buffering whenever there's room for it on the videocard; it 
      will provide you with a much more flexible framerate.</P>

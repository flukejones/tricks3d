<p>In this paper, we present our new graphical rendering concept
called Voxel Texturing. It is a derivative of voxel landscaping
and texture mapping. In Voxel Texturing, three-dimensional
objects are rendered from a single polygon with a voxel landscape
mapped on it. This technique has resulted in both large speed
increases and increased quality over flat polygonal rendering.
Voxel-textured polygons are very easy to manipulate. Memory
requirements are significantly decreased. Complex
three-dimensional effects are achieved faster and with greater
ease.

<H3><FONT COLOR=YELLOW><I>Introduction</I></FONT></H3>

<p>Voxel Texturing is a derivative of two methods of rendering
commonly used today. Voxel rendering<sup>1,2</sup> is commonly
used for creating landscapes because of its ability to handle
rough surfaces without compromising speed. These landscapes are
made of lines, or voxels, drawn from a pixel on a flat bitmap
(note: the term &#145;voxel&#146; can also refer to a cubic unit,
but for this paper, we assume a line). Texture mapping<sup>3,4,5,6,9</sup>
is commonly used in rendering objects with easy manipulation.
Texture mapping onto polygons is used in most real-time
simulations (for example, games) because of its speed. However,
the objects made from these textured polygons can only have a few
polygons to maintain an average of fifteen to twenty frames per
second. Thus, objects appear &quot;blocky&quot; because the edges
are usually easily visible and unrealistic. When voxel
landscaping is combined with flat polygonal texturing, the ease
of manipulation, speed, and versatility of polygonal rendering is
combined with the realism, quality, and ease-of-manipulation of
voxels creating a high-speed rendering system with all of the
beneficial qualities of both rendering methods with few
limitations. We have denominated this rendering system
&quot;Voxel Texturing.&quot;

<p>We created Voxel Texturing to speed up rendering of objects,
to increase quality and definition of rendered objects, and to
increase ease of object creation. Voxel Texturing, after testing
and rendering, does exceed current rendering in speed,
versatility, definition, resolution, and creation. The concept
involves replacing the pixels of a textured polygon (in
three-dimensional space) with lines perpendicular to the polygon.
The height of each of these lines is specified in a height-map.
Thus, the final rendered product consists of a voxel landscape
mapped onto a polygon. With variable voxel heights, a few
voxel-textured polygons (generally two polygons) can make entire
objects, whereas with flat polygonal rendering, an equivalent
object would need hundreds or thousands of polygons. Thus,
rendering speed is significantly increased over flat polygonal
rendering. In addition, quality can increase. Since Voxel
Texturing involves a surface made of pixels rather than polygons,
then the highest definition is exactly one pixel. Therefore, the
highest definition possible is easily achieved (lower definition
can be achieved by make a level surface) allowing real-time
simulations to have movie-quality objects. With flat-polygonal
rendering, many small polygons must be created to equal the pixel
definition of voxel texturing. Another type of rendering, volume
rendering<sup>7,8</sup>, can achieve maximum quality. This method
involves placing voxels, in this case voxels are referring to a
cubic area, or volume element, in three-dimensional positions
specified by a three-dimensional array. Volume rendering requires
a three-dimensional matrix that requires every pixel to be drawn.
For a 100x100x100 object, one million pixels would have to be
rendered, making this method too slow for real-time simulation
while requiring immense storage and each of the one million
pixels to be drawn. Voxel Texturing can replace volume rendering
as well, in most cases by achieving equivalent quality but with
improved speed. For high-quality rendering, Voxel Texture
rendering is most often the best choice. Considering that an
object created with Voxel Texturing consists of raised lines, the
creation of an object is as simple as drawing a topography map in
a paint program with colors representing heights.

<p>In comparison with creating an object with flat polygons,
Voxel Textured objects are much easier to create because flat
polygons require special hardware (most commonly, a magnetic
positioning pen to plot points of an object in the computer) for
rendering actual objects. If this hardware is not used,
painstaking creation of every vertex to make polygons small
enough to create a smooth surface is required. Voxel Texturing
only requires a two-dimensional object (for example, a
photograph) and a paint program to create voxels. Voxel Texturing
is made from a two-dimensional picture instead of chopping up a
picture to make each piece or polygon of the picture. As an
example of the speed increase with Voxel Texturing, a sphere with
one thousand polygons was rendered <u>fifty</u> <u>times</u>
faster with Voxel Texturing. With this speed increase being one
of the smaller increases in speed clocked, there is little doubt
that Voxel Texturing will replace, or at very least augment,
every type of rendering in existence today.

<H3><FONT COLOR=YELLOW><I>Rendering Procedure of a Voxel Textured Polygon</I></FONT></H3>

<OL>
<LI>1. A picture (texture) and height map are created (see
procedure: &quot;Creating a Voxel Textured Polygon&quot;). The
vertices of the polygon are assumed to be co-planar, and the
polygon is assumed to be a quadrilateral.
<LI>2. Normal polygonal texturing is applied. In the case of
perspective-correct rendering, each pixel along the polygon is
projected. A line, in the final product, replaces each of these
pixels. The corresponding height map is also textured.
<LI>3. To ensure that the voxels are perpendicular to the polygon
surface, a vector cross product is performed using any three
points of the polygon. The returned number is the normal to the
polygon.
<LI>4. From each point on the polygon, a line is projected
parallel to the polygon&#146;s normal. This line has a length
equal to the height specified on the height map (at the
corresponding point) and a color equal to the corresponding
number on the texture map. The line starts from the pixel being
extended.
<LI>5. Once every line has been drawn, the process is complete.
</OL>

<H3><FONT COLOR=YELLOW><I>Creating a Voxel Textured Polygon</I></FONT></H3>

<OL>
<LI>1. As normally performed in creating a flat polygon, a picture
is created to apply to the polygon as a texture.
<LI>2. To create the height map, a paint program can be used to
draw a topography map. This can be done by using colors to
represent heights considering the colors represent numbers. The
numbers (colors) from the topography map are read by the engine
as heights.
<LI>3. Once the picture and height map are finished, the process
is complete and the values are stored. In special programs we
have written, a paint program and voxel editor are combined and
the values are stored in a single file.
</OL>

<H3><FONT COLOR=YELLOW><I>Shading a Voxel Textured Polygon</I></FONT></H3>

<p>Note: To achieve shading, the angle of the surface and the
vector of a light source are required.

<OL>
<LI>1. The position of a surface pixel and its four adjacent
surface pixels must be found (if a pixel is on the side of a
height map so that there are fewer adjacent pixels, as many as
possible are used).
<LI>2. Four vectors must be found by subtracting the four adjacent
pixel positions from the center (once again, if there are fewer
adjacent pixels, fewer vectors can be found).
<LI>3. A cross product is run between the center and two adjacent
vectors. Once this cross product is run on each adjacent vector,
four normals should now be known.
<LI>4. The four normals are averaged to get a single normal
representing the center pixel.
<LI>5. This normal is normalized.
<LI>6. A dot product performed on this new normal and the vector
of the light source yields a number between -1 and 1. The closer
the number is to -1 or 1, the brighter the pixel should be.
<LI>7. The value that is returned is multiplied times the red,
blue, and green components of the center pixel&#146;s color. The
returned numbers represent the colors of the shaded voxel.
<LI>8. Once every voxel has been shaded (steps 1-7), the process
is complete.
</OL>

<H3><FONT COLOR=YELLOW><I>Procedural Analysis</I></FONT></H3>

<p>Since creating a voxel-textured polygon involves simply
drawing a height map and a picture, voxel-textured objects are
much easier to create than objects composed of flat polygons.
Whereas an object rendered with flat polygons would require well
over a thousand polygons to appear smooth, Voxel Texturing
requires simply raising voxel heights in succession. Flat
polygons usually require professionals or expensive equipment to
create anything of quality. However, with Voxel Texturing,
objects can be created with such ease that almost any person can
make extremely high-quality objects. Objects digitized or scanned
can be converted into three-dimensional objects simply by raising
the pixels of the image. With flat polygons, the digitized image
has to be separated and then positioned in three dimensions.
Thus, the quality of a real person, object, or just about
anything can be copied into the three-dimensional world of the
computer with greater speed and ease.

<p>This data represent benchmark tests run with our programs. All
data were collected at the same distance (Z) from the camera
(viewing point in the computer). The wire frames of the spheres
are below (figures 3,4). The wire frame of the voxel-textured
sphere would just be a single polygon because voxels are spawned
from it. Notice that to make the same object, fewer
voxel-textured polygons are needed. To make a sphere, two
voxel-textured polygons are laid on top of each other (each with
an opposite vector) so two hemispheres can make a full sphere.
The reason that voxel-textured polygons can have any definition
is that they can easily attain the highest definition by varying
voxel heights in many places. By making voxels have constant
slopes (an area of constant slope), a lower definition can be
attained. According to the data, one voxel-textured polygon is
equal to approximately ten flat polygons. However, an entire
object can be created with one voxel-textured polygon so that
Voxel Texturing will almost always speed up and increase the
resolution of an object. If most plain objects use six polygons
(cube), if the time for four more polygons were allocated, then a
voxel-textured polygon could be used to give the object maximum
quality. Also, it is important to realize that the engine used
could still greatly benefit from more optimizations. By dividing
the high-definition sphere composed of flat polygons (figure 5),
which is still not equal to the definition of a voxel-textured
polygon, by the voxel-textured sphere, the speed increase is
found. By using voxel-textured polygons, the speed increase is
greater than <u>50.5 fold</u> (since the definition of the
voxel-textured polygon is still higher). Comparing our data to
other engines, such as Micro Lathe&#146;s<sup>®</sup> engine,
better data turns up. Rendering a 1,000 polygon sphere in Micro
Lathe<sup>®</sup> took about 5.13 seconds. Thus, using our Voxel
Texturing engine would be 142.5 times faster. Once again, the
best definition spheres can be created with only two
voxel-textured polygons (.036 seconds). A volume rendered sphere
took even more time but obtained the same definition possible
with Voxel Texturing. A volume-rendered sphere took approximately
6.35 seconds. By using Voxel Texturing, 176.3 fold increase in
speed occurs.

<H3><FONT COLOR=YELLOW><I>Uses of Voxel Texturing</I></FONT></H3>

<p>Voxel Texturing can replace most methods of rendering. Because
Voxel Texturing is extremely fast while maintaining digitized
quality and definition, Voxel Texturing is perfect for use in
real-time simulations. Walls, floors, and ceilings can be
rendered with true texture rather than with artists&#146; tricks
and flat surfaces. Thus, side views of walls and structures show
accurate renditions of what the artist intended. Currently, our
algorithm supports an average rendering speed of twenty flat
polygons to one voxel-textured polygon. This represents
preliminary results and can be optimized many times over. As an
example, when rendering dice, six polygons would usually be used,
each with a different texture, forming a cube. However, dice are
not cubes, they are rounded and curved on the edges and have
small semi-circles cut out. This holds true for most objects.
Thus, it may take an extra hundred polygons to make a perfect,
true-to-life die. One voxel-textured polygon can make this same
object in a fraction of the time.

<p>Objects that require great detail and work to manipulate, such
as faces with changing expressions, can be rendered with Voxel
Texturing to create maximum realism. With voxel texturing, an
actual face can be rendered onto a head in three dimensions, and
the face can change as though it were part of an animation. The
height map can also change with the texture to correlate with
moving parts.

<p>Since an entire object can be rendered with one voxel-textured
polygon, movement requires fewer vertex transformations than with
flat polygonal rendering. For an object to be rotated, only a few
vertices of the voxel-textured polygon must be rotated; whereas
with flat polygonal rendering, it might be necessary to rotate
well over a thousand vertices. The same holds true for regular
transformations and scaling.

<p>Varying the sizes of the voxels on the height map can create
many effects. By lowering values, effects such as weapon blasts
can be &quot;carved&quot; out of the Voxel Texture to make the
appearance of a blast radius in a wall, ceiling, or floor. By
lowering values to zero, a hole can be created in the wall, or
perhaps the entire wall could be decimated, in which case the
engine should remove the wall from the game to save time. In
simulations involving blasts Voxel Texturing supplies the means
necessary to show the effects of an explosion easily, cheaply,
and quickly.

<p>Voxel Texturing is a perfect solution to the slow speed that
exists in the Internet and other low bandwidth networks. By
sending over a picture and height-map, only a list of commands
must follow to move the object in three dimensions on the client
computer. Thus, instead of sending over a picture for every frame
(as is done with most Internet animations), only two frames are
sent over. After that, commands, which may only take a byte each,
can be passed at increased rates. By putting a plug-in on the
client&#146;s computer that reads and displays voxel textures,
Voxel Texturing could replace most animations and clips on the
Internet today.

<p>Three-dimensional animations can be performed simply by
altering the texture (as is normally done in videos and
animations) and by altering the height map to correspond with the
texture. Or, a pseudo method of animation would be to make a base
height map which is constant with a changing texture. From a
distance, this would appear realistic.

<p>Voxel Texturing has the ability to achieve effects in
real-time not attainable with other rendering methods. Our
base-shading algorithm (See &quot;Shading a Voxel Textured
Polygon&quot;), not including the color transformation, can give
the vectors of each surface. These vectors can be used in
reflection, shading, and lighting. Reflection is most impressive.
By compromising a minute amount of speed, mirrors can be created
with dents, ripples, and just about any effect (including
changing voxel heights, which creates some interesting effects).
By sending out a ray from a surface pixel parallel to its normal,
an intersecting pixel can be found. The voxel color is replaced
with this pixel so that it appears to be reflecting this pixel.
Lighting and shading are based on the algorithm mentioned above
(&quot;Shading a Voxel Textured Polygon&quot;).

<H3><FONT COLOR=YELLOW><I>Optimizations</I></FONT></H3>

<p>When creating objects with voxel texturing, there is a high
probability that only a small fraction of most voxels is seen
(that area that is not covered by other voxels). To avoid drawing
covered areas, the lowest adjacent voxel height can be found by
checking the surrounding heights on the height-map and starting
the voxel from that lowest point (as opposed to starting from the
underlying polygon).

<p>Voxel Texturing can be used in conjunction with flat polygonal
rendering in many instances to achieve better results. When
something is perfectly flat or is small enough that a voxel
textured polygon is not necessary, flat polygonal rendering is a
valid substitute.

<p>Much information can be pre-stored to avoid unnecessary
calculations by the engine. The texture and height-map are
obviously stored. The vectors of the surface pixels can also be
pre-computed. Also, run-length-encoding can be used on the height
map because there is a high probability that many values are the
same (for example, zero would be a common value for unseen
areas).

<p>Collision detection can be greatly enhanced by creating an
invisible box (not displayed) that surrounds the voxel texture.
This box would specify the minimums and maximums of the voxel
texture (in other words, it would be a perfect fit for the voxel
texture). Thus, the engine can detect if the surrounding boxes of
two voxel-textured polygons are intersecting. If a box does
intersect, further collision detection would occur, such as
detecting whether or not some voxels intersect.

<p>Most optimizations for flat polygonal rendering can be used
for Voxel Texturing. However, a few do not. BSP trees for static
objects can be used to specify walls. If the wall is destroyed
however, the texture cannot be removed for fear of disrupting the
BSP tree (unless it is specially designed to be dynamic).
Otherwise, a BSP tree would work as an advantage. Back face
culling is not worth implementing for voxel textures. The only
case in which a voxel texture could be unseen would be if its
vector were equal to the camera&#146;s vector and both their
positions were collinear. In most other cases, the voxels may be
seen extending from the side. It is recommended, however, that a
simulated scene have all voxel-textured polygons that cannot
possibly be seen (for example, the other side of a sky) removed
or tagged so the engine never draws them.

<H3><FONT COLOR=YELLOW><I>Conclusion</I></FONT></H3>

<p>Voxel Texturing has the speed, versatility, ease-of-creation,
resolution, definition, and low storage usage to replace or at
least to improve all current forms of rendering. The fact that a
voxel-textured polygon is created in a two-dimensional space (the
height map and picture) allows this rendering system to be
significantly easier to work with than the three-dimensional
space required for creating a flat polygonal object. Thus, Voxel
Texturing is perfect for Internet use because of the low
bandwidth most people have. The quality that Voxel Texturing can
easily supply allows for Voxel Texturing to work to create almost
any object more efficiently and more quickly. For almost every
three-dimensional simulation that exists, Voxel Texturing can
supply more quality, speed, and versatility than any other
rendering system.

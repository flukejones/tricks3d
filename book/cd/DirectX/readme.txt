README.TXT for /DirectX directory

"Tricks of the 3D Game Programming Gurus-Advanced 3D Graphics and Rasterization"
Created: 1.1.03 by Andre' LaMothe

This directory contains both the DirectX 9.0 SDK files and the DirectX 9.0 Run-time files. 
All the demos from the book were compiled with the DirectX 9.0 SDK. However, they will run with
DirectX 8.1 or better interfaces, so you don't necessarily have to install the DirectX 9.0
run-time, but I highly recommend it! Moreoever, the demos will compile with DirectX 8.1 SDK
as well if you already have it installed and simply don't have room for the DirectX 9.0 SDK.

The table below describes each of the files within this directory and their usage.
